I wanted a bare-bones program for SDL2 + OpenGL 2D rendering that also compiled to JS+WebGL with Emscripten. There are some SDL2 + OpenGL tutorials out there but most of them don't target the WebGL subset of OpenGL. I can't use the fixed function pipeline, so older OpenGL code won't work, and I can't use newer things like vertex array objects, instancing, or geometry shaders, so newer OpenGL code often won't work.
